Large collection of solutions to coding interview practice questions

Nearly all of these files are solutions to practice interview problems from Gayle Laakmann McDowell's "Cracking the Coding Interview, 6th Edition".
The book is excellent, but the solutions are not in Javascript. Hopefully this can serve as a study resource to budding software engineers who want to take their tests in Javascript!
