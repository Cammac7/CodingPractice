# CodingPractice
Large collection of javascript solutions I wrote to coding interview practice questions

Nearly all of these files are solutions to practice interview problems from Gayle Laakmann McDowell's "Cracking the Coding Interview, 6th Edition".
The book is excellent, but the solutions are not in Javascript. Hopefully this can serve as a study resource to budding software engineers who want to take their tests in Javascript!

#Use
Rather than work with node, there is an HTMl file in this repo. You can clone the repo, and change the js link in that file to view different solutions in the console (by loading the html file in your browser).

#This repo also has
- a folder with some python practice (an implementation of the card game "war")
- architecture for basic data structures you should know
- algorithms you should be able to code from scratch (search, mergesort, etc.)
